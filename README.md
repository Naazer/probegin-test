# Probegin Test Assignments

The right candidate takes an isuue and creates new branch from master, then submits a pull request according to the given specification

Please take the single task at once (e.g. 1 PR = 1 issue)

Tests must contain data providers for valid and invalid cases (at least 5 each), and also cover edge cases

* NOTE: interfaces do provide all necessary methods, i.e. you cannot add more methods to the classes that implement an interface
